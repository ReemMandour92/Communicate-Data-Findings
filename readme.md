As Udacian studying in Data Analyst Track, a Prosper Loan sample dataset for borrowers is included with other datasets to study and record interesting insights about data. The dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan.  Data is loaded and cleaned to prepare for exploratory and explanatory phases.


### <u>Summary of Findings</u>

The main key factors that affect the APR rate is credit score and prosper score. As the credit score increases, the APR rate decreases; as the prosper score increases, the APR rate decreases too. The percentage or coefficient of increase or decrease is not fixed, since APR decision considers multiple variables. Also, data gives weak to moderate linearity, which requires revisiting the data and suggesting calculations and operations, to yield accurate APRs. The other affecting variables (income, loan amount) in general have weak to moderate linear relationship with APR, despite that it is expected to see strong linear relationship through visuals. Scaling the loan and income data gives us better interpretations, which leads us to see that they are indirectly proportional to APR. This means that high income borrowers received low to moderate APRs with the requested loan amount. Most of borrowers are employed mainly fulltime and self employed with incomes that cover their loans. Most credit scores range from 600 to 800, with few exceeding 800 as great borrowers. Most prosper scores range from 4 to 8, with 4 bad, low score and gradually increasing to 8 good, high score. Also, few borrowers got super high-risk scores ranging from 9 to 11. The salaries have recorded values less than or equal $20000, with few exceeding this number. The loans are consistent with incomes, so lenders have a beginning expectation that their loans can be confidently covered. Other variables had little or no effect on APR rate such as on time payments and loan payments. These variables are important in indicating any loan approval and should be taken in future loans with more concern. 

### <u>Key Insights for Presentation</u>

The presentation displays the analyses conducted to reach what the main factors impacting the APR rates are and ends with a conclusion about the data and how we can improve measures for future loans. 

The analyses introduce the APR rate, followed by factors that impacts the APR rate. The factors are plotted individually to explore and get a quick overview of sample data. The data is plotted in relation to APR, to see how they impacted the APR.  The final insights involve plotting of more than two factors to reach a conclusion.
